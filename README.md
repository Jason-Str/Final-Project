# Final-Project
The Final Project for my Python for Data Science Class

Using a Huggingface model to build a toxicity classifier, We used Youtube videos to evaluate how toxicity affects communities. In this case it would be the communities of the Youtubers.
Youtuber commmunities have been steadily increasing throughout the years because of ease of access to the internet and Youtube being free.
We analyze the Youtuber comments and how they affect the Youtubers and their communities. Toxicity can have different effects depending on the context and we can seperate toxicity from neutral comments by using this model
